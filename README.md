## WHAT IS DATA?
Data is "01". Certainly! Data, in its raw form, represents isolated facts or observations without context or meaning. However, when data is structured, analyzed, and contextualized, it transitions into information, which holds significance and relevance for understanding, decision-making, and problem-solving.

## DATABASE AND DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM?
A database is a structured collection of data organized in such a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It typically consists of tables, each containing rows and columns representing individual records and attributes, respectively. Databases are used to store and retrieve data for various purposes, such as managing information about customers, products, transactions, and more.

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software designed to facilitate the creation, maintenance, and utilization of databases. It provides an interface for users to interact with the database, allowing them to perform tasks such as adding, modifying, and querying data. Additionally, a DBMS handles tasks such as data security, concurrency control (ensuring multiple users can access the database simultaneously without conflicts), backup and recovery, and optimization of queries for efficient data retrieval. Popular examples of DBMS include MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
