## WHAT IS DATA?
Data is "01". Certainly! Data, in its raw form, represents isolated facts or observations without context or meaning. However, when data is structured, analyzed, and contextualized, it transitions into information, which holds significance and relevance for understanding, decision-making, and problem-solving.
